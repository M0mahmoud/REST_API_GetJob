# Building a REST API for a Job Application Website with Node.js and Express

## Steps to Build the API (MVC Architecture)

### Step 1: Project Setup

- [x] Initialize Project
- [x] Install Dependencies

### Step 2: Model Layer

- **Set Up MongoDB Models**
  - [x] Define data models for user accounts, company accounts, and job postings using Mongoose schemas.
  - [x] Establish relationships between models, such as jobs belonging to companies.

### Step 3: Controller Layer

- **User and Company Authentication**

  - [x] Implement user registration and login controllers.
  - [x] Create company registration and login controllers.

- **Job Posting Controllers**

  - [ ] Create controllers for creating, reading, updating, and deleting job postings.
  - [ ] Implement authorization checks to ensure only authorized users can perform these actions.

- **Validation and Error Handling**
  - [ ] Implement validation using `express-validator` in controllers.
  - [ ] Handle errors with appropriate status codes and error messages.

### Step 4: View Layer (API Endpoints)

- **Create Express Routes**

  - [ ] Set up routes for user authentication and registration.
  - [ ] Define routes for company authentication and registration.
  - [ ] Create routes for managing job postings.

- **Middleware and Request Processing**
  - [ ] Implement session management using `express-session`.
  - [ ] Implement middleware for authentication and authorization.

### Step 5: Testing

- **Test Your API**
  - [ ] Utilize tools like Postman, Jest, or other testing frameworks to test all API endpoints.
  - [ ] Test various scenarios including valid and invalid inputs, authentication, and authorization.

### Step 6: Deployment

- **Deployment**
  - [ ] Choose a hosting platform.
  - [ ] Set up environment variables for sensitive information.

### Step 7: Documentation

- **Documentation**
  - [ ] Create API documentation using tools like Swagger or other documentation frameworks.
  - [ ] Document endpoints, request payloads, response structures, and authentication requirements.

## Additional Notes

- This guide follows the MVC architecture to help organize your codebase effectively.
- Implementing proper security practices is crucial, including data validation, error handling, and secure authentication.
- Consult the official documentation of each dependency to ensure accurate and up-to-date implementation.
- Adapt and extend these steps based on the specific needs and features of your job application website.
