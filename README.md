# Building a REST API for a Job Application Website with Node.js and Express

## Steps to Build the API (MVC Architecture)

### Project Setup

- [x] Initialize Project
- [x] Install Dependencies
- [x] Define data models for user accounts, company accounts, and job postings using Mongoose schemas.
- [x] Establish relationships between models, such as jobs belonging to companies.
- [x] Implement user registration and login controllers.
- [x] Create company registration and login controllers.
- [ ] Create controllers for creating, reading, updating, and deleting job postings.
- [ ] Implement authorization checks to ensure only authorized users can perform these actions.
- [ ] Implement validation using `express-validator` in controllers.
- [ ] Handle errors with appropriate status codes and error messages.
- [ ] Set up routes for user authentication and registration.
- [ ] Define routes for company authentication and registration.
- [ ] Create routes for managing job postings.
- [ ] Implement session management using `express-session`.
- [ ] Implement middleware for authentication and authorization.
- [ ] Utilize tools like Postman, Jest, or other testing frameworks to test all API endpoints.
- [ ] Test various scenarios including valid and invalid inputs, authentication, and authorization.
- [ ] Choose a hosting platform.
- [ ] Set up environment variables for sensitive information.
- [ ] Create API documentation using tools like Swagger or other documentation frameworks.
- [ ] Document endpoints, request payloads, response structures, and authentication requirements.

## Additional Notes

- This guide follows the MVC architecture to help organize your codebase effectively.
- Implementing proper security practices is crucial, including data validation, error handling, and secure authentication.
- Consult the official documentation of each dependency to ensure accurate and up-to-date implementation.
- Adapt and extend these steps based on the specific needs and features of your job application website.
